> I want to learn machine learning. I have basic knowledge of python, numpy,
 panda and matplotlib. 
But I am beginner in machine learning. I want to be expert in machine 
learning. 
I want you to do deep research on the web, on the kaggle and on the github 
and give me at least 7 project ideas by completing those, I will be able to 
know the bits and bytes of machine learning. 
You will keep these requirements in mind when selecting the projects - 
1. Projects msut be based on real life issues. 
2. It will follow order ( easy to difficult)
3. Public dataset. 
4. I can implement different types of model in the same project. 
5. I will be able to master feature extraction after completing the 
projects. 
6. Project should be standard so that I can showcase these in my portfolio. 
7. Projects should be only focused on dataset processing, feature 
engineering and popular model using and custom hybrid model designing. 
===========================
Now response to my queries. 

● I'll conduct comprehensive research across the web, Kaggle, and GitHub to find the best ML project ideas for your learning journey. Let me search multiple sources.
